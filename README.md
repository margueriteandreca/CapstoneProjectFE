Kinta is a social media app that allows users to post text or images, with an emphasis on curating oneâ€™s feed. 
I noticed that when I had free time to leisurely edit photos or draft up my thoughts, it was often at a time that would produce little to no engagement, such as the middle of the night.
I created Kinta so that the user can easily schedule posts for the future, and once their chosen date and time is selected, the post is automatically made public once that time has passed. 
Users can also easily save their posts to drafts, view them, edit them, 
and decide whether they want to post now or in the future. 
Scheduled posts can always be modified for another time.
